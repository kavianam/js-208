# Blog 

#### This project is describle a simple blog website. I use React.js for writing it.

We should take these steps to run my project:

1. start json server with blog.json file in the json-server folder on 3000 port. Like this: `json-server --watch blog.json`

2. run `npm i` or `npm install` to download dependencies for React.js. Because port 3000 is full you should consider a diffrent port for it!

Now you have everything you need to test my project!
